Forked from https://github.com/qbalsdon/pico_rgb_keypad_hid - b96effaca0511eda36ee13b0a3edbb3e2c238482 and refactored to add features I wanted.  The upstream project went in a different direction than I wanted to go, adding some complexities that I didn't need. It was recently archived, as the author has switched to QMK. I may make the same switch in the future.
